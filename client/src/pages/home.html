        Welcome to <strong>Kemono,</strong> a scraper for Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox, SubscribeStar, Gumroad, Discord, DLsite, and Fantia. Contributors here upload content from paywalls, and share it here for easy searching and organization.<br>
        To get started viewing paywalled content, either search for creators on the <strong>[Artists]</strong> tab, or search for content on the <strong>[Recent Posts]</strong> tab.<br>
        If you want to contribute content, click the <strong>[Import]</strong> tab.

      <p>
        <b>July 7, 2021 -</b> Comment importing has been implemented for Patreon artists. You <i>do not</i> need to flag anything; comments will automatically appear the next the importer encounters their posts.<br>
        <b>June 25, 2021 -</b> Added Fantia support.<br>
        <b>June 13, 2021 -</b> It's been a stressful few days, but we've managed to more or less fix the performance issues with small tweaks to how the site works. Additionally, multiple reliability improvements have been made to the importer. I'm aware Partychan is down, but I don't own/manage the servers and the person who does has not responded to my messages. Regardless, I will try my best to get the board back up and running as soon as possible.<br>
        <b>June 8, 2021 -</b> The Gumroad importer has been patched. The SubscribeStar importer is currently non-functional for unknown reasons; investigations are underway.<br>
        <b>June 6, 2021 -</b> Added the announcements section. Watch this space for the latest updates and developments!
